# Food-Near-you
While using CSS/JS/HTML I created a online Food Finder using the google api. 
Setting this up and understanding how to use this. I used this my getting permission of users location and then having them enter a radius near them. This then filters restaurants that are near them. I plan on developping this more in the future as more of a app like tinder. Hardest part of this was working with google api and just trying to understand how to use it with my code.
